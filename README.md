# SIGS - Seismic Inferences for Glitches in Stars (using frequencies)

Fit acoustic glitches in low-degree p-mode frequencies using the PIKAIA genetic algorithm

This program is independent but was developed alongside [sigs-diff](https://github.com/Fill4/sigs_diff) which fits acoustic glitches using the second differences of the frequencies.

## Description

This program fits the signal due to the acoustic glitches at the base of the convection zone and at the Helium second ionization region, by iteratively removing a smooth component from low-degree p-mode frequencies.

The signal used to describe the oscillatory signature of the glitches, adapted from the work of Faria [2013], is of the form:

More details regarding the development of the methods from this repository can be found here: __to be added__

## Dependencies

This program requires the LAPACK and BLAS libraries

In Linux these can be installed by running the command:

```
sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev
```

## Compiling

```
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Fill4/sigs_freq
# Move to repository folder
cd /path/to/repo/
# Compile
make 
```
## Usage

To use the code it is necessary a file with the format of [sun.freqs](tests/sun.freqs) with the frequencies of oscillation of a star
Then run the command:
```
./sigs_freq -v -p
```
and when prompted, select the location of the frequencies file and click Enter.
The command -p shows the plots of the final fit and the final parameters will be printed to a file Results_freq.
More commands and ways of executing the code are available and can be consulted __here__

## Testing
To test the compilation go the tests folder and execute

```
sigs_freq -v -p < freqs
```

The plots will appear at the end of execution and the file Results_freq will have the final parameters of the fitted function
