Implement lambda iteration
Implement initial guess (Change in rescale instead of Pikaia)
Improve convergence (Try different methods instead of limiiting possible values)

Check changes made Feb 7, 2016 - Some change in variables caused values to stop converging to correct solution. Nothing should be affected because only unused variables were removed.
