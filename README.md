# SIGS - Seismic Inferences for Glitches in Stars (using frequencies)

Fit acoustic glitches in low-degree p-mode frequencies using the PIKAIA genetic algorithm

## Description

This program fits the signal due to the acoustic glitches at the base of the convection zone and at the Helium second ionization region, by iteratively removing a smooth component from low-degree p-mode frequencies.

The signal used to describe the oscillatory signature of the glitches, adapted from the work of Faria [2013], is of the form:
