Fit acoustic glitches in low-degree p-mode frequencies using the PIKAIA genetic algorithm.

== Description ==

The program fits the signal due to the acoustic glitches at the base of the 
convection zone and at the Helium second ionization region, by iteratively
removing a smooth component from frequencies of very low degree.
See Monteiro et al. (1994) for details.

It considers the functional forms for the signals as presented in 
Mazumdar et al. (2012), with a total of 7 free parameters in the fit:

* A_bcz
* tau_bcz
* phi_bcz

* A_HeIIz
* beta_HeIIz
* tau_HeIIz
* phi_HeIIz


== Compilation ==

1. In the Makefile, change 'BASE' to the directory where you have the "glitch" folder.
2. Also change 'lib' to the directory where the library is.
