Implement lambda iteration
Implement initial guess (Change in rescale instead of Pikaia)
Improve convergence (Try different methods instead of limiiting possible values)
Correct parsing error on common/init


Feb 7, 2016 - Some change in variables caused values to stop converging to correct solution. Nothing should be affected because only unused variables were removed.

Feb 8 - Lambda needs to be a dp variable so that the results are decent.

Feb 10 - Output has now simple information on results and separate flags for iteration complete information and plot toggle.
