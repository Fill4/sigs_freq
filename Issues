Implement lambda iteration
Implement initial guess (Change in rescale instead of Pikaia)
Improve convergence (Try different methods instead of limiiting possible values)
Correct parsing error on common/init


Feb 7 - Some change in variables caused values to stop converging to correct solution. Nothing should be affected because only unused variables were removed.

Feb 8 - Lambda needs to be a dp variable so that the results are decent. Solved Feb 7 problems.

Feb 10 - Output has now simple information on results and separate flags for iteration complete information and plot toggle.

Feb 11 - Need to have more constrain on the values of rescale. In the Cyg A example there is no correct convergence to correct result because another smaller value for tau_bcz results in lower chi_2.
